# VACJOKE.NET
A simple project provides you with some clantag changers.

## Can I get VAC BANNED if I use these scripts?
- If you just use the *CSGO Biniding Based Changer*,it's impossible for you to recieve a VAC ban by using this script.
- If you use the *AutoHotKey Based Changer*,you have a really small chance to recieve a ban,I don't know if vac will detect AHK,AHK didn't caused any ban for me.
- If you use the *External Clantag Changer*,**it is _POSSIBLE_ for you to recieve a _VAC BAN_**,the external changer will have some actions that only hacks will do and **THERE'S NO ANTI DETECT MEASURES**

## Pre-Requirements
